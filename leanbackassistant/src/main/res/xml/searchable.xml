<!-- The attributes below configure the Android search box appearance
     and the search suggestions settings.
     See the Developer Guide for more information
     http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/search/

     The Assistant's priority order for intent actions are as follows:
         1) Intent specified in cursor(SUGGEST_COLUMN_INTENT_ACTION)
         2) Intent specific in this file (searchSuggestIntentAction)
         3) ACTION_SEARCH(default)

    It is recommended to set it to ACTION_VIEW in searchable.xml and only override in code if you
    want to handle certain pieces of content differently.
